# 👋 Hi, I’m Dorcas Olujimi  

IT Professional | Cybersecurity Analyst (Blue Team) 

I’m an IT Support and Cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in user support, troubleshooting, incident analysis, and secure system operations. I enjoy translating technical issues into clear solutions while building a strong foundation in defensive security through practical labs and real-world scenarios

I’m currently transitioning deeper into cybersecurity, with a focus on:

Security Operations (SOC)

Identity & Access Management (IAM)

Risk Management & Security Awareness

Threat Analysis and Detection
