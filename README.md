# 👋 Hi, I’m Dorcas Olujimi  

**Cybersecurity Analyst | SOC Monitoring | Threat Detection | Incident Response | Security Awareness**

I help organisations strengthen their defenses through **threat detection, vulnerability management, and security awareness initiatives**.  
My focus lies in bridging the gap between technology and people - building systems that not only detect threats, but also educate users to prevent them.
